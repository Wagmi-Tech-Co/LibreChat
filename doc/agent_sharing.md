# Agent Sharing Documentation

## Recent Changes Summary

This document summarizes the key changes and actions taken in the LibreChat project during the recent development and debugging sessions.

### 1. Agent Sharing Bug Fixes

- **Issue:** Agents shared with individual users via the `sharedWithUsers` field were not appearing for those users.
- **Backend Fix:**
  - Updated the `getListAgents` function in `api/models/Agent.js` to include agents where the current user's ID is present in the `sharedWithUsers` array, in addition to agents authored by the user or marked as global.
  - Restarted the backend to apply the fix.
- **Result:** Shared agents now appear for users they are shared with.

### 2. Environment Variable Handling

- **Clarification:** After updating the `.env` file, only the backend needs to be restarted for environment variable changes to take effect. The frontend does not require a restart for these changes.

### 3. Agent Usage Permission Error

- **Issue:** Shared users received an error when trying to use a shared agent: "An error occurred while processing your request. Please contact the Admin."
- **Backend Fix:**
  - Identified that the `loadAgent` function only checked if the user was the author or if the agent was global, but not if the agent was shared with the user.
  - Updated `loadAgent` to also check if the current user's ID is in the `sharedWithUsers` array.
  - Restarted the backend to apply the fix.
- **Result:** Shared users can now use agents shared with them without encountering errors.

### 4. Git Remote and Branch Operations

- **Remote Update:** Changed the Git remote to point to `https://github.com/Haris-Alsaman/LibreChat.git`.
- **Branch Push:** Pushed the `share-agent` branch (commit `e32b9facd9732f502a19a6c6b1e31ffab00df483`) to the new remote.
- **.env.example Restoration:** Restored the deleted `.env.example` file.
- **Pull Request:** Provided a link to create a pull request for the new branch on the Haris-Alsaman repository.

### 5. General Practices

- Followed project rules for robust error handling, code consistency, and clean commit history.
- Ensured all changes were made file-by-file and preserved existing code structure.

## UI Improvement Task (2025-07-16)

**What:** Refine the Agent Sharing UI by combining select/deselect buttons into a single toggle and fixing the edit permission toggle functionality.

**Why:** These improvements will enhance usability by simplifying the selection interface and ensuring consistent behavior of permission controls regardless of sharing scope.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Replace separate "Select all" and "Deselect all" buttons with a single toggle button labeled "Select All" ("Tümünü Seç")
2. The "Select All" toggle should switch between selecting all users and deselecting all users
3. Ensure the "allow other users to edit your agent" toggle remains functional when specific users are selected for sharing
4. The edit permission toggle should work consistently across all sharing scenarios (specific users or all users)

**Test Cases:**

Verify the "Select All" toggle correctly selects and deselects all users

Confirm the edit permission toggle can be activated when sharing with specific users

Test that edit permissions are correctly applied when sharing with specific users

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

Handle partial selection states (some users selected, some not) when using the toggle

Ensure proper state persistence when navigating away and returning to the sharing UI

Consider accessibility requirements for the new toggle button

## MCP Loading Animation Implementation (2025-07-16)

**What:** Implemented a loading icon animation that displays whenever a tool request is sent to an MCP server, providing visual feedback from request initiation until response receipt.

**Why:** Previously, there was no visual indication when tool requests were sent to MCP servers, making it unclear if requests were being processed and leading to user confusion and potential duplicate requests.

**Implementation Details:**

**Components Added:**
- `MCPLoadingIndicator.tsx` - Animated loading indicator with pulse ring effect
- `MCPLoadingContainer.tsx` - Container to manage multiple concurrent loading states
- `MCPLoadingProvider.tsx` - Context provider for global loading state management
- `useMCPLoading.ts` - Custom hook for managing MCP loading states

**Key Features:**
1. **Animated Loading Indicator**: Shows spinner with pulse ring animation during MCP tool execution
2. **Server and Tool Identification**: Displays which MCP server and tool are being called
3. **Timeout Handling**: Shows warning after 30 seconds, auto-timeout after 60 seconds
4. **Error State Management**: Shows error icon and message when requests fail
5. **Concurrent Request Support**: Multiple loading indicators for simultaneous MCP calls
6. **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects and pulse animations for better UX

**Integration:**
- Added to `Root.tsx` as context provider
- Integrated with `ToolCall.tsx` for MCP tool calls
- Displayed in `ChatView.tsx` above the chat input

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
✅ Appropriate loading icon animation aligned with platform UI/UX  
✅ Appears immediately when tool requests are sent to MCP servers  
✅ Remains visible until response is received  
✅ Positioned to clearly associate with specific tool requests  
✅ Handles multiple concurrent requests with individual indicators  
✅ Gracefully disappears when responses are received  
✅ Proper error state handling for failed/timeout requests
